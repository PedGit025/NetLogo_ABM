For your Modeling Project, you must select a system to model and define what phenomena or behavior you want to characterize, observe, and or experiment with.

    What system would you like to build a model of?

    What are the principal components or actors involved in this system?
    How will you model the system (ABM, network, cellular automata, etc.)?

 

For ABMs and cellular automata

    What actions (or behaviors) can the agents/actors take? 

    In what kind of environment do these agents operate? Describe the basic environment type (e.g., spatial, network, featurespace, etc.) and fully describe the environment.

    If you had to “discretize” the phenomenon into time steps, what events and in what order would occur during any one time step? Fully describe everything that happens during a time step.

    What are the inputs to the model? Identify all relevant inputs.

    What do you hope to observe and assess from this model? Identify all relevant outputs.
